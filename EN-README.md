## About the reasons for high GPU usage
..

## The problem of not being able to access the Internet after shutting down and turning on the computer again
*The system agent could not be cleaned in time because [Doisnet](https://github.com/dodois/Doisnet) did not exit properly.*

**Windows Solutions**
1. Restart Doisnet
> [Doisnet](https://github.com/dodois/Doisnet) will repair the system agent at each boot, so turn it on again to fix it
